# Mini basketball training cone (3D files)

Here’s a custom basketball training cone I designed so I can practice basketball drills and improve my skills.

This cone is mini compared to the standard one, but it works well to practice dribbling, crossover,... and it is stackable and easily printable.

This repo contains the STL but I have also included the design file (FreeCAD file) so you can modify the dimensions to suit your needs.

On a side note, I already have a FreeCAD course (in Arabic) on YouTube if you want to learn how to 3D design using the open source program FreeCAD, and here’s the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GH1UzPbO2F4&list=PL-pfG3NLl5jY2lb_iF0CPEH7DVZws4aDY
